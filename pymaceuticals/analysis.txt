  There are many different conclusions that we can make from our work analyzing the data. First, we can clearly see that Capomulin and Ramicane have the most observed mice timepoints out of all the drug regimins. Even though they had the most timepoints, we can see in our box and whisker plot that Infubinol and Ceftamin have a much higher mean tumor volume amoung the treatments. When we looked at the tumor volume of one mouse who was on Capomulin, as the number of days went up, the tumor volume generally went down. Sticking with Capomulin, we see as the weight of the mice increases, the higher the average tumor volume. We also know that the regression model generally fits becasue the correlation coefficient is high at 0.84.
